#  Security Portfolio – r00tSid

Welcome to my **security portfolio**.  
This repository showcases a collection of **audit reports** I’ve completed on smart contracts and protocols, highlighting vulnerabilities, proofs of concept, and recommended mitigations.  

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate **practical experience in Web3 security auditing** while continuously learning and improving.
